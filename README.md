I am betavirus, a passionate programmer :computer: and an information security enthusiast who loves to develop efficient and robust software. From early on in my life, I was very fascinated with computers, and at around 12, I assembled my own PC (I love playing PC games). From there, I started to fall in :heart: with technology. Over the years, I have collected several tools ðŸ›  in my arsenal, making me extremely flexible with the [technology stack](https://sphutela.me/resume). I enjoy developing software for varied platforms, and my recent fascination lies with Web3 and its possibilities.

_<pre>First, figure out the problem and then start writing the code.</pre>_

- :purple_heart: Kind people are my kinda people
- Child at heart (**I see the world as magical**) :sparkles:
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/his

_<pre>Code like a story, not a puzzle.</pre>_

## Ask me about :speech_balloon:

- :computer: Competitive programming, data structures, algorithms
- Fullstack and mobile :iphone: development
- :octocat: Open source, :cloud: Cloud computing, :rocket: DevOps
- Software testing :hammer:
- :closed_lock_with_key: Information security
- Web3 Enthusiast :world_map:
  - Exploring decentralized applications (dApps)
  - Smart contracts with Solidity and Rust

## Current Focus :sparkles:

Iâ€™m delving deeper into:
- Building dApps that bring value to users.
- Leveraging blockchain for transparency and security.
- Exploring interoperability in decentralized ecosystems.
- Enhancing user experience in the Web3 world through intuitive designs.

_<pre>Though Web3 is still evolving, its potential is limitless!</pre>_
